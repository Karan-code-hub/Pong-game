# Pong-game
Pong is a clasical arcade game ,the game is played by two players. Each player has controll over his/her own paddle which could only move vertically across the left/right side of the screen. The goal of the game was to hit the moving ball and hope that the other player would miss it. If the oponent does miss it, then you get a point. 
I have coded this game using turtle, as i tried to make the code simple so that you can understand the code very easily.
Turtle is good for simple game development but if you want to make good games like flapy bird,space invaders etc.You will need to use the pygame library of python.
If you want to built your first game in python using pygame.
You can check my profile as i also have a repository for Space_Invaders and if you have any problem regarding the code or want to give me suggestions you are most welcome i will dfinately go through your problems or suggestios.
